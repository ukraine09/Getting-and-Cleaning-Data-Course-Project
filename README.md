# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

# CodeBook.md 
describes data set and main steps in process of cleaning and organizing project data.

# run_analysis.R performes following steps: 
Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
